ICS File Generator
==================

Generate [iCalendar](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5545) files.

This is a fork! The original project can be found here: https://www.npmjs.com/package/ics

With my version, you can add more events into one ICS file. I use it with Node 4.2.2. Might work on it later. To convert it to npm package with support.
